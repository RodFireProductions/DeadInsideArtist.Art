		<h3>General</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<mark>
					No work of mine is to be repurposed as NFTs or involved with crypto in any regard.
				</mark>
			</li>

			<li>
				I can deny commissions for any reason.
			</li>

			<li>
				Pieces can take from a week to a month to be completed. Keep in mind I'm a student.
			</li>

			<li>
				All characters must have visual reference(s). Will not take description only references.
				If this is the first time your OC is ever being drawn, reference images for the clothing,
				hair, etc, along with some description is accepted.
			</li>

			<li>
				Unless commercial prices are paid, one can only use a commission for personal reasons.
				One cannot make profit off of it.
			</li>

			<li>
				I, the artist, have the rights to post the commission, my work, on my socials and portfolios.
				I'm willing to tag the commissioner on said posts unless asked otherwised.
			</li>

			<li>
				All preparation materials, visuals, and sketches, including all exectronic files used to create the project remain my property.
			</li>

			<li>
				Credit is apperciated but not required when posting the commission on the condition one doesn't
				claim to have drawn the piece oneself. Do not resell my art either.
			</li>

			<li>
				I will only remove my signature if commission was bought with commerical prices.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Payment</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Payment is to be paid in full upfront.
			</li>

			<li>
				I accept payments through PayPal and Ko-fi.
			</li>

			<li>
				Paying for the added commercial price can happen after initial payment
				if one decides later on that one wishes to make profit off of it.
			</li>

			<li>
				Requesting multiple or big changes may result in one needing to pay an added fee.
			</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>Refunds and cancellations</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				A commission can not be refunded after the piece is completed.
			</li>
			<li>
				I can cancel a commission for any reason. Payment will be refunded completely
				if not completed. This only counts if I, the artist, cancels on the client.
			</li>

			<li>
				One can cancel a commission at anytime if it's yet to be completed.
				How much of the price gets refunded depends on how big the piece was
				and how far I was into it.
			</li>


		</ul>
