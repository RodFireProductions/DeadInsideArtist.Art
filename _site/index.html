I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

First line with two spaces after.  
And the next line.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.

I just love **bold text**.
I just love __bold text__.
Love**is**bold

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
A*cat*meow

This text is ***really important***.
This text is ___really important___.
This text is __*really important*__.
This text is **_really important_**.
This is really***very***important text.
